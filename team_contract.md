# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**

    The team will meet at a minimum once a week to deliver updates and to-dos for the week.

    Meetings can last anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour, or even more if necessary.

    Because we are all good friends, we will try to meet in person ideally but have established a Discord server to meet if that doesn't work out for any given week.
    
    The Github repo history will show our incremental progress and we can also record meeting updates and notes if necessary.

2. **Assistance** 

    We will expect responses from each member regarding any help or assistance with the project to be very quick, again because we are all friends. 
    
    Members will reach out through text or Discord messaging, and the response will be fast. 
    
    We'll reach out via email to the project mentor, Abhilash, for more complicated issues.

3. **Respect** 

    We're all close friends. We all have respect for each other and have experience working together already.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    All of our members are capable and will pull their weight for the project. 
    
    We will create distinct Github branches for the repository to keep track of progress per member, discuss our work at meetings and then merge into the main branch.

5. **Time Commitment** 

    We all want to work on a project we're passionate about so we don't have a set time allotment for every member. We just expect that everyone is genuinely interested in the project itself and because of that they will put in the time and effort needed. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    Once again, we're all good friends outside of class and we will speak up and be transparent with each other when the situation calls for it.
